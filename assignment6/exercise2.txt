Difference between TrustRegionLS.m and solverCM2dSubspaceExtLS.m

(1) TRUSTREGIONLS Trust region iteration for large scale problems

(2) SOLVERCM2DSUBSPACEEXT Solves quadratic constraint trust region problem with possibly indefinite Hessian via 2d subspace

In (2) the gradient and hessian are computed as handlers.
(2) Approximates the Hessian if indefinte using iterative solver if the dimension is larger then 10, else get smallest eigen value

(2) Check for three cases in B, negative eigenvalues, zero eigenvalues or postive eigenvalues a,b,c
